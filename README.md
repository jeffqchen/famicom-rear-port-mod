# Famicom Rear Port Mod
The Nintendo Famicom has been nagging me for almost my whole life with its non-detachable controllers and awkward length of the cord. So here is the solution to scratch that itch.

3D model slicer examples as shown in the pictures for best appearance/structural strength.

To keep the original appearance with the controllers, you can replace the long wire from original Famicom controllers with a NES controller extension corder, cut into desired length.

2P microphone pin is populated on an N/C pin, if you want to use it, get a 7-pin zapper extension cord instead (pricier).

====================  
Prints:  
- You may need to file/cut/drill away any inaccuracies in order to fit the parts together correctly.

Soldering demonstration included in pictures.  
- Some pins are N/C so I didn't waste my money populating them.  
- Don't use too much solder since the space inside is pretty constrained.  
- Wire pinout is serialized. It should be very straightforward. Don't cross the streams!  
- Wire pin holes are also compatible with 2mm and 2.54mm pitched pins, if you prefer  
using pins for connection. Remember to cut the protruding from the other side or it won't fit.
